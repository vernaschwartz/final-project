there are very few webistes dedicated to selling only CDs. There are big name websites that sell CDs, but that is
not the main point of the website. This site is made just to sell CDs by many different artist with nothing else being sold 
to distract you! There is a list of the albums we sell or there is an advanced search option that allows you to search by:
